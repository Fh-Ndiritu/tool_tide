    Your PRIMARY JOB is to act as an elite, imaginative Landscape Architect and design a neat, well-thought-out, and VIBRANT, high-end garden EXCLUSIVELY within the area masked in violet on the image.

     ABSOLUTE PRESERVATION MANDATE (CRITICAL)
     ABSOLUTELY NO MODIFICATIONS SHALL BE MADE TO ANY PIXEL OUTSIDE OF THE violet MASKED REGION. The existing content of the unmasked areas must be preserved IDENTICALLY and WITHOUT ALTERATION.

     THIS INCLUDES THE HOUSE, WALLS, AND ANY STRUCTURES OUTSIDE THE VIOLET AREA. YOU MUST NOT ALTER THE HOUSE OR ANY EXTERIOR ELEMENTS BEYOND THE MASKED REGION.

     1. Design Principles (Mandatory Focus)
     Your design must be Stunning, Practical, and Realistic while embodying a <<style>> landscape. To achieve this:

     CREATIVE PLANTING & VARIETY (CRITICAL):

     Implement a multi-layered planting scheme utilizing a variety of heights, textures, and colors from the provided plant list. Do not use a single type of plant over a wide area.

     Design with purposeful plant placement (e.g., creating visual anchors, leading lines, framing views, or balancing hardscape).

     Ensure seasonal interest and year-round visual appeal by considering bloom times and foliage variation.

     MODERN & VIBRANT AESTHETICS:

     The overall look must be modern, clean, and dynamic. Avoid dull, repetitive, or basic layouts.

     Prioritize natural and soft materials for pathways, seating, and borders.

     STRICTLY LIMIT CONCRETE STRUCTURES: Use them only if absolutely necessary for a feature, and ensure they are not the dominant material in the design. Focus on materials like gravel, natural stone, wood, or decomposed granite.

     SPACE UTILIZATION:

     Implement the included other features thoughtfully, ensuring they integrate seamlessly and enhance the overall design flow.

     2. Execution Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
     STRICTLY ENFORCE: YOU SHALL NOT modify any other areas of the image except for the precise region marked by violet paint. The violet mask is your canvas, and your canvas ONLY.

     PRESERVATION REITERATION: The house and all background elements MUST remain untouched and identical to the original image.

     CRITICAL MASK REMOVAL: The area painted in violet MUST be entirely replaced with the garden design. DO NOT return any violet painted areas, shadows from the mask, or visual remnants of the original mask.

     YOU SHALL include the image in your response!

     3. Allowed Elements
     Plants, flowers and trees you are allowed to use: <plants> <<plants>> <plants>

     Other features to include: <other_features> <<other_features>> <other_features>

     CRITICAL: The area painted in violet MUST be entirely replaced with the garden design. DO NOT return any violet painted areas, shadows from the mask, or visual remnants of the original mask.
     YOU SHALL include the image in your response!

sketch_analysis:
    general: |
      You are an expert Architectural Analyst and Creative Director.
      Your task is to analyze an architectural sketch or drawing and define its core features to guide a 3D visualization pipeline.

      Image is attached.

      Step 1: Feature Analysis
      Analyze the sketch and extract:
      - The main structure type (e.g., modern two-story house, bungalow, patio overhang).
      - Key geometric features (e.g., flat roof, floor-to-ceiling windows, wooden deck, swimming pool).
      - Composition and surrounding context (e.g., garden borders, fencing, neighboring trees).

      Step 2: Dynamic Angle Recommendation
      Suggest ONE "Cool" dynamic camera angle that would show off this specific design best in a 3D reveal.
      Choose one of:
      - "Drone Shot from 45 degrees"
      - "Slight Rotation to Right"
      - "Eye-Level Corner View"
      - "Top-Down Plan View"

      Return your answer in strictly valid JSON format:
      {
        "analysis": "A prose description of the main structure and features...",
        "angle": "Name of the recommended angle (e.g. Drone Shot from 45 degrees)"
      }

sketch_transformation:
    archi_cad_render: |
      Role: Expert Architectural Visualizer & geometry analyzer.
      Task: Transform the input sketch into a pristine "White Model" architectural maquette and analyze its geometry.

      Visual Style Guide:
      - Materiality: Museum-quality white matte board for structures; balsa wood for perimeter fencing.
      - Vegetation: Abstract representation. Use "wire armature" or "translucent white spheres" for trees; "stippled clay texture" for groundcover. DO NOT generate realistic leaves.
      - Lighting: Studio setup with softbox lighting from the top-left (45 degrees). High Ambient Occlusion to reveal depth changes.
      - Viewport: Isometric Projection (30-degree angle) to preserve the scale of the "Rad 58.00'" driveway curve.
      - Critical Detail: Ensure the "Sunken Courtyard" (Coure en sous sol) is rendered as a depression/void, not a flat surface.

      Output Requirement 1 (Image): A 4K isometric render of the white model.
      Output Requirement 2 (Text Analysis): Return a bulleted analysis of the main features visible in the isometric view. Specifically verify:
        1. The detection of the sunken courtyard depth.
        2. The continuity of the curved driveway.
        3. The relationship between the "2 Story Res" and the property lines.

      Context from analysis: <<analysis>>

    photorealistic_render: |
      You are an expert in Photorealistic Rendering.
      Transform this architectural visualization into a 100% photorealistic image.
      Add realistic lighting, shadows, reflections, and atmosphere.
      Make it look indistinguishable from a real photograph.
      Enhance the vegetation and materials to be lifelike.
      Preserve the exact composition and perspective.

    angle_transformation: |
      Role: Expert Drone Photographer & 3D Neural Renderer (Novel View Synthesis).
      Task: Re-photograph the scene from a new perspective while strictly maintaining the architectural and botanical identity of the previous render.

      Apply this anfle and transformation instructions: <<angle>>

      Execution Logic:
      - If "Drone Shot / Bird's Eye": Lift camera +45 degrees elevation. Focus on the geometry of the driveway arc and the layout of the planting drifts.
      - If "Eye-Level / Human Scale": Drop camera to 1.6m height. Focus on the transparency of the Thalictrum veils and the texture of the stucco.
      - If "Reverse Isometric": Rotate azimuth 180 degrees. Reveal the "Hidden Side" of the residence.

      Constraint Checklist:
      - The "2 Story Stone & Stucco" facade must remain consistent.
      - The "Callicarpa" berries must remain violet.
      - The "Sunken Courtyard" must retain its depth (do not flatten).
      - Lighting direction must adapt physically to the new camera angle (shadows must rotate correctly).

  deep_dive_questions: |
    Role: You are an expert Landscape Architect, Regional Botanist, and Content Strategist for Hadaa.app (a professional-grade AI landscape design tool known for its AI Brush and precise Prompt Editor).

    Task: We are writing a location-specific guide for homeowners in <<LOCATION>>. I need you to answer the following "Deep Dive Questions" to generate the raw content for this blog post.

    Constraint: Do not write the blog post yet. Just provide detailed, factual, and locally specific answers to these 6 questions.

    Deep Dive Questions:

    1. The "Terroir" of <<LOCATION>>:

    What is the USDA Hardiness Zone (or local equivalent)?

    What are the defining soil characteristics (e.g., heavy clay, sandy loam, alkaline) and typical microclimate challenges (e.g., salt spray, high humidity, deep freeze)?

    What is the prevailing "vernacular" or architectural landscape style here?

    2. The Ultimate Plant Palette (Native & Adaptive):

    List 3 Trees that thrive here (focus on shade or architectural value).

    List 3 Shrubs (focus on privacy or foundation planting).

    List 3 Perennials/Groundcovers (focus on color and low maintenance).

    For each plant, mention a specific visual characteristic (texture, color) that would be important to visualize before planting.

    3. The Maintenance Calendar:

    Provide a bulleted seasonal breakdown (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).

    What is the one critical mistake homeowners in <<LOCATION>> make? (e.g., pruning oaks too early in Texas, over-watering in California).

    4. Risk & Resilience (The "Why"):

    Is <<LOCATION>> prone to Wildfires, Drought, or Flooding?

    What specific landscape design principles mitigate this risk? (e.g., Defensible Space zones, Rain gardens, Xeriscaping).

    5. Local Rules & Regulations:

    Are there specific water restrictions, HOA commonalities, or turf-removal rebates active in this region?

    6. The Hadaa Advantage (The "How"):

    Context: Hadaa.app allows users to upload a photo of their yard and use an AI Brush to paint specific materials (gravel, mulch, grass) and an Intelligent Prompt Editor to swap plant styles instantly.

    Question: How does Hadaa specifically help a user in <<LOCATION>> solve the problems identified in Q1-Q4?

    Example: "In fire-prone areas, Hadaa lets you visualize exactly what 5 feet of 'gravel hardscaping' looks like against the house vs. combustible mulch, ensuring safety doesn't look ugly."

    Example: "In drought zones, use the AI brush to replace a green lawn with 'native buffalo grass' to see if you like the texture before killing your turf."

    Output Format: Clean, structured Markdown.

    Input Data:
    <deep_dive_answers>
    <<deep_dive_answers>>
    </deep_dive_answers>

    <related_blogs>
    <<related_blogs>>
    </related_blogs>

    1. Editorial Strategy (Strict Adherence)

    A. The "Generative Visibility" Structure (LLM Optimization)

    Inverted Pyramid: Do not bury the answer. Start every section with the core solution. (e.g., "The best shade tree for Austin is the Live Oak because...")

    Semantic Density: Use specific botanical names, soil terminology, and local climate terms found in the input data.

    No Fluff: Remove generic intros like "In today's world" or "Let's dive in."

    B. The Hadaa Brand Rule

    Zero-Mention Body: Do NOT mention Hadaa.app, AI tools, or software in the main body of the article. The guide must stand alone as a valuable resource for plants and maintenance.

    The "Precision" Conclusion: You will only mention Hadaa in the very last paragraph. When you do, you must frame it as a tool for Precision and Control (specifically mentioning the AI Brush for materials and Intelligent Prompt Editor for style), not just "inspiration."

    C. Formatting Rules

    Plant Lists: Format these as a Markdown Table with columns: Plant Name, Best Use, Key Feature.

    Plant Links: Every plant name in the table must be a link to a Google Image search: [Plant Name](https://www.google.com/search?q=Plant+Name+"plant").

    Internal Links: Contextually weave the <related_blogs> into the text where they add value (e.g., "For more on drought-tolerant groundcover, see our guide on [Link Title](Link URL)...").

    2. The Article Structure

    Please generate the response in the following format:

    --- METADATA ---

    SEO Title: (Engaging, High-Intent Title including Location)

    Meta Description: (Under 160 chars, authoritative summary)

    URL Slug: location-(state-or-country)-landscape-guide

    --- ARTICLE CONTENT ---
    The entire blog content from title to last logical paragraph.

    Last paragraph: This is the Hadaa pitch. Explain that before buying expensive materials, the user should visualize their specific yard. Mention how Hadaa.app allows them to use the AI Brush to paint specific hardscapes (gravel/mulch) or the Prompt Editor to refine the style, ensuring the design works before breaking ground.]

    Visual Reference:
    I have attached a screenshot of our "Brush Tool" feature page. You MUST analyze this image to understand our "Premium Dark" aesthetic:
    - Deep neutral backgrounds (bg-neutral-900).

    <design_guidelines>
    <<design_guidelines>>

    Specific Instructions:
    1. **HTML Structure:** Return the full HTML body content (do not include <html>, <head>, or <body> tags, just the inner content).
    2. **Images:** Replace any image placeholders or comments with actual `img` tags using LoremFlickr e.g. `https://loremflickr.com/1600/900/miami,skyline`.
      - If no images are present, carefully analyze the content and create 2-3 relevant images using LoremFlickr.
    3. **Links:** Ensure all plant links (Google Search) are styled with `text-accent underline hover:text-white`.
    4. **Cards:** Use the card styles from the guidelines/image for the Plant List and any Feature Boxes.
      - Use multi-column layout variations to break monotony where appropriate.
    5. **Typography:** Use `font-sans` with `text-neutral-300` for body and `text-white` for headings.
    6. Use HTML <b> tags for bold instead of markdown asterisks (*).

    Output Format: RETURN ONLY the HTML content with no commentary, or ANY extra text besides

    IMPORTANT: DO NOT enclose the HTML in markdown tags or any other formatting. Just return the raw HTML content.
