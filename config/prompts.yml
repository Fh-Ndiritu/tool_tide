    Modern Chic Cottage: The Organized Vibrant Sanctuary
    Professional Role & Creative Intelligence You are a Lead Modernist Landscape Architect specializing in "Chic Cottage Maximalism." Your goal is to transform the violet-masked area into a breathtaking, high-density floral garden that maintains rigorous geometric order. It must look like a high-end designer show-garden from the Chelsea Flower Show—vibrant, lush, but perfectly disciplined.

    Spatial Analysis & Modern Geometry (Thinking Mode) Analyze the masked region and apply a "Linear Abundance" logic:

    The Modern Frame: Organize the garden into clean, repeating rows or geometric "blocks" of color. Avoid random scattering.

    Architectural Seating: Carve out a clear, rectangular or circular "Destination Zone" featuring low-slung luxury furniture (e.g., charcoal metal frames with white linen) set upon a clean-edged stone terrace.

    High-Contrast Paths: If a path is used, use oversized, rectangular ivory pavers with "razor-sharp" edges, surrounded by dark polished stones to define the walking route clearly.

    The "Intense Vibrancy" Botanical Strategy Use an unapologetic, diverse plant palette organized by color and height to ensure zero "bushy" mess:

    Saturated Color Blocks: Create massive, dense "drifts" of electric-purple Salvia, neon-pink Peonies, and vibrant "Goldenrod" Yellow. Each color should exist in its own clear, intentional zone.

    Sculptural Spines: Instead of round bushes, use vertical "Sky Pencil" Hollies or Foxgloves (Digitalis) to provide rhythmic vertical accents that act like living columns.

    The Living Carpet: Use a dense, low-growing "uniform" groundcover like silver-blue Dichondra or neon-green creeping thyme to fill every gap. There must be zero exposed soil.

    Ordered Climbers: Use a freestanding, minimalist black steel trellis to host a "sheet" of vibrant Climbing Roses or Clematis. The growth must be manicured and contained within the frame.

    Materiality & High-Contrast Hardscape

    Hardscape: Use oversized, matte-finish ivory Porcelain or light Grey Travertine. The light-colored stone is essential to act as a "canvas" that makes the bright floral colors pop.

    Edging: Use black powder-coated steel edging to create a 100% straight, visible line between the planting beds and the gravel/stone areas.

    Mulch: Use pure white quartz pebbles or jet-black river stones to finish the beds, providing a clean, "magazine-ready" look.

    Photographic Execution (8k Photorealism)

    Perspective: Render with a 35mm wide-angle lens at f/11 for a deep, crisp architectural focus.

    Lighting Dynamics: Match the original photo’s sun angle. Use "Golden Hour" lighting to saturate the reds, purples, and yellows, making the garden look like it is glowing.

    Shadow Physics: Every flower spike and piece of furniture must cast a sharp, physically accurate shadow to ground the design into the scene.

    Technical Mandate

    Zero Mess: No overgrown or "wild" looks. All plants must look manicured and placed with intent.

    Complete Mask Eradication: The violet mask must be 100% replaced. No purple halos.

    Structural Independence: All new features (furniture, trellises, planters) must not touch or modify the existing house walls.

  zen: |
    Zen Landscape Architecture Brief: The Lush Modern Sanctuary
    Professional Role & Creative Intelligence You are a Lead Zen Landscape Architect specializing in "Lush Japanese-Modern" fusion. Before rendering, analyze the violet-masked area for its potential to become a high-impact, botanical retreat. Your objective is to transform this space into a breathtaking, vibrantly green and floral Zen garden that looks like a luxury estate feature from Architectural Digest.

    Spatial Analysis & Density Logic (Thinking Mode) Analyze the masked region and prioritize botanical density over hardscape:

    The "Living Sea" Concept: Instead of a sea of gravel, create a "sea of moss and ferns." Limit raked gravel to small, intentional "accent rivers" or narrow paths, allowing 80% of the area to be lush plant life.

    Architectural Seating: Incorporate a low-slung, floating dark timber meditation deck (Engawa) or a "Zen Nook" with minimalist outdoor furniture set directly into the lush surroundings.

    Independent Structures: If space allows, add a modern, freestanding black timber gate (Torii style) or a minimalist stone water feature to act as a focal point.

    The "Extreme Vibrancy" Zen Strategy Do not settle for a few sparse plants. Use high-density massing to create a "wow" factor with zero exposed soil:

    Primary Sculptural Anchors: Multiple specimen Japanese Maples (Acer Palmatum) with vibrant fire-red and burnt-orange leaves to provide a massive color pop. Include cloud-pruned (Niwaki) pines for structural elegance.

    The Lush Carpet (Zero Soil): Every inch of the ground must be covered in a thick, velvety carpet of emerald-green Moss, Sagina Subulata, and neon-green Creeping Jenny.

    Chromatic Drifts: Layer in massive blocks of electric-pink and white Azaleas, vibrant blue Japanese Iris, and deep-purple Forest Grass (Hakonechloa).

    Tactile Texture: Mix the broad, glossy leaves of Japanese Fatsia with the feathery, layered fronds of Ostrich Ferns and the vertical lines of Black Bamboo.

    Materiality & High-Contrast Luxury

    Hardscape: Use oversized, natural basalt stepping stones (Tobi-ishi) that "float" within the dense moss.

    Refined Accents: Limit white gravel or silver-grey sand to small, razor-sharp geometric "islands" or zen-circles to provide a clean architectural contrast against the vibrant greenery.

    Mulch & Finish: Use jet-black polished river stones to border the moss beds, making the greens and maple reds appear more saturated and luminous.

    Photographic Execution (8k Photorealism)

    Perspective: Render with a 35mm wide-angle lens at f/11 for a deep, crisp architectural focus.

    Lighting Dynamics: Match the original photo’s sun angle. Use "Golden Hour" lighting to make the red maple leaves glow and the moss look dew-drenched and vibrant.

    Shadow Physics: Ensure every bamboo stalk, maple leaf, and stone casts physically accurate shadows to ground the design into the scene.

    Technical Mandate

    No Bare Ground: The garden must look established and lush; the ground should be a continuous tapestry of moss, stones, and foliage.

    Complete Mask Eradication: The violet mask must be 100% replaced. No purple halos or artifacts.

    Structural Independence: All new features (decks, furniture, water basins) must stay within the mask and not modify the existing house architecture.


  desert: |
    Desert Landscape Architecture Brief: The High-End Arid Sanctuary
    Professional Role & Creative Intelligence You are a Lead Desert Landscape Architect specializing in luxury arid-scaping and "Desert Modern" design. Before rendering, you must carefully analyze the violet-masked area for its scale, light, and proximity to architectural features. Your objective is to transform this space into a breathtaking, vibrant, and ultra-chic desert garden that looks like it was curated from a Pinterest-trending "Palm Springs Modern" board or a Dwell magazine feature.

    Spatial Analysis & Design Logic (Thinking Mode) Analyze the masked region and apply these high-end desert design principles:

    Scaling: If the space is narrow, create a "Xeric Border" with rhythmic cactus groupings. If the space is deep, create an "Arid Oasis" featuring a central specimen tree and a minimalist fire pit or structural boulder arrangement.

    Function: Identify entries. If a path is needed, ensure it uses high-contrast, heat-reflective materials like white limestone or oversized sand-colored concrete pavers.

    Add-ons: If the area allows, incorporate sleek minimalist outdoor lighting (LED path lights to highlight cactus silhouettes), a modern steel fire feature, or a few statement-sized architectural boulders (e.g., golden granite or red lava rock).

    The "High-Variety" Vibrant Desert Strategy Reference a diverse and cohesive plant palette that proves desert gardens are incredibly vibrant and textured. Avoid simple dirt; choose plants with "wow factor":

    Sculptural Anchors: Specimen Joshua Trees, multi-armed Saguaro cacti, or massive Golden Barrel cacti arranged in clusters.

    Chromatic Drifts: Massive blocks of electric-red "Firecracker" plants (Russelia), neon-orange Aloe blooms, vibrant purple "Desert Sage," and silver-blue Agave Americana.

    Tactile Texture: Mix the "spiky" aggression of Ocotillo with the soft, blue-grey fuzz of "Old Man" cacti and the fine, needle-like leaves of Palo Verde trees.

    Vertical Drama: Use tall, slender "Mexican Fence Post" cacti to create organic, vertical screens that frame the architecture.

    Materiality & High-Contrast Hardscape Ensure all materials scream "luxury" and handle the desert aesthetic:

    Hardscape: Use oversized, matte-finish pavers in ivory or sand tones. Paths should feature clean, geometric lines.

    Mulch & Finish: Use high-quality decomposed granite in "Apache Brown" or pure white crushed quartz to make the vivid greens and oranges of the succulents "pop." Integrate weathered Corten steel edging for a sharp, rusty-orange contrast against the desert floor.

    Photographic Execution (8k Photorealism)

    Perspective: Render as if captured with a 35mm wide-angle lens at f/11 for a deep, crisp architectural focus.

    Lighting Dynamics: Match the original photo’s sun angle, but saturate the vibrant colors as if they were shot during a high-contrast midday sun or a glowing "Desert Sunset" for maximum pop.

    Shadow Physics: Every cactus spine, boulder, and architectural leaf must cast long, physically accurate, and sharp shadows that ground the design into the scene.

    Technical Mandate

    Complete Mask Eradication: The violet mask must be 100% replaced. No purple halos or artifacts.

    Seamless Fusion: The new garden must look as if it has been established for years, fitting perfectly flush against the existing house walls and unmasked terrain.

    Mediterranean-Modern Fusion: The High-Impact Vibrant Coastal Sanctuary
    Professional Role & Creative Intelligence You are a Lead Modernist Landscape Architect specializing in "High-End Mediterranean Maximalism." Your goal is to transform the violet-masked area into a breathtaking, overflowing floral sanctuary that feels incredibly lush, sun-drenched, and architecturally intentional. It must look like a multi-million dollar coastal estate featured in Architectural Digest.

    Spatial Analysis & High-Impact Tiering (Thinking Mode) Analyze the masked region and apply a "Lush-but-Layered" logic:

    The Chromatic Mid-ground (The Heart): Fill the central mid-ground with an explosion of saturated color. Use dense, rounded shrubs of vibrant Lavender and Rosemary, punctuated by massive, waist-high clusters of blue Agapanthus.

    Vertical Framing (The Spires): Use the tallest elements—slender Italian Cypress or gnarled, multi-trunk specimen Olive trees—at the extreme left and right edges of the mask to frame the house perfectly.

    The Lifestyle Terrace: Carve out a clear, high-contrast zone for a modern patio featuring low-slung luxury furniture (white linen or teak) and a minimalist path of oversized honey-colored Travertine pavers.

    The "Extreme Vibrancy" Mediterranean Strategy Use an unapologetic, diverse plant palette with massive scale and saturated colors:

    Primary "Wow" Anchors: Massive, gnarled specimen Olive trees in oversized minimalist pots and tall, rhythmic Italian Cypress spires.

    Intense Chromatic Drifts: Massive, dense groupings of electric-magenta Bougainvillea, neon-blue "Lily of the Nile," and vibrant orange Bird of Paradise.

    Vertical Floral Drama: Use a freestanding modern timber pergola or metal trellis for an aggressive, overflowing display of vibrant Red Climbing Roses or purple Wisteria. Keep it lush and dense but independent of the house walls.

    The Living Carpet: Every square inch of the mask must be covered. Use silver-grey Dichondra and vibrant green Moss to fill every gap between the larger flowering plants.

    Materiality & High-Contrast Hardscape

    Hardscape: Use oversized, matte-finish Travertine or Limestone pavers in warm ivory. The light stone must act as a reflector to make the floral magentas and purples appear 50% more saturated.

    Contrast Accents: Integrate large, high-end glazed ceramic planters in cobalt blue or deep emerald green to provide permanent "pops" of geometric color.

    Finish: Use fine-textured terracotta gravel or white river pebbles to maintain a clean, high-contrast foundation.

    Photographic Execution (8k Photorealism)

    Perspective: Render with a 35mm wide-angle lens at f/11 for edge-to-edge crispness and deep architectural focus.

    Lighting Dynamics: Match the original photo’s sun angle. Use a crisp, clear "Golden Hour" light to make the terracotta tones feel warm and the flowering blooms look luminous and high-definition.

    Shadow Physics: Ensure every cypress spire and flowering branch casts a physically accurate, textured shadow, creating a sense of "coastal depth."

    Technical Mandate

    Complete Mask Eradication: The violet mask must be 100% replaced. No purple halos or artifacts.

    Structural Independence: All new features (pergolas, seating, trellises) must stay within the mask and not modify the house architecture.

    Strategic Clearance: Maintain the house's architectural visibility by keeping the densest floral massing just below the window lines in the center.

  tropical: |
    I really have a hair-trigger finger today! I promise to keep the architect in the drafting room.

    Here is the Tropical Modern adaptation. It maintains the architectural precision of the Modern prompt but swaps the palette for lush, oversized foliage and the intense, electric colors of a high-end Balinese or Brazilian resort.

    Tropical Modern Landscape Architecture Brief: The High-End Vibrant Jungle Sanctuary
    Professional Role & Creative Intelligence You are a Lead Modernist Landscape Architect specializing in "Tropical Modernism" and luxury resort design. Before rendering, you must carefully analyze the violet-masked area for its scale, light, and proximity to architectural features. Your objective is to transform this space into a breathtaking, vibrant, and ultra-chic tropical garden that looks like it was curated from a Pinterest-trending "Tropical Modern" board or an Architectural Digest feature.

    Spatial Analysis & Design Logic (Thinking Mode) Analyze the masked region and apply these high-end design principles:

    Scaling: If the space is narrow, create a "Vertical Jungle Gallery" with layered heights. If the space is deep, create a "Tropical Destination Patio" with zones for luxury lounging or a minimalist stone water feature.

    Function: Identify entries. If a path is needed, ensure it has high-contrast colors (e.g., White Quartzite vs. Dark Basalt) and creates a logical, rhythmic flow through the foliage.

    Add-ons: If the area allows, incorporate sleek minimalist outdoor lighting (LED spike lights to highlight leaf textures), a modern patio area with low-slung furniture, or high-end oversized matte-black planters.

    The "High-Variety" Tropical Vibrancy Strategy Reference a diverse, cohesive, and incredibly lush plant palette. Do not settle for common greenery; choose plants that provide "wow factor" through massive leaves and electric colors:

    Sculptural Anchors: Giant "Bird of Paradise" (Strelitzia nicolai), multi-trunk Traveler's Palms, or specimen Monstera Deliciosa.

    Chromatic Drifts: Massive blocks of "Black Magic" Colocasia, neon-red Anthuriums, electric-orange Bromeliads, and vibrant variegated Crotons (yellow, red, and green).

    Tactile Texture: Mix the massive, glossy "shield" leaves of Alocasia with the feathery softness of Tree Ferns and the waxy, structural spikes of ornamental Ginger.

    Vertical Drama: Use tall, slender Bamboo screens or freestanding trellises with modest climbing Passionflower or vibrant Red Mandevilla to frame the architecture.

    Materiality & High-Contrast Hardscape Ensure all materials scream "luxury" and provide a crisp frame for the jungle:

    Hardscape: Use oversized, matte-finish porcelain pavers in deep charcoal or volcanic black. If a path is chosen, consider an "in-moss" stepping stone look with razor-sharp edges.

    Mulch & Finish: Use jet-black polished river stones or dark volcanic rock mulch to make the neon greens and deep reds of the tropical leaves appear more saturated and intense.

    Photographic Execution (8k Photorealism)

    Perspective: Render as if captured with a 35mm wide-angle lens at f/11 for a deep, crisp architectural focus.

    Lighting Dynamics: Match the original photo’s sun angle, but saturate the vibrant colors as if they were shot during a humid, clear "Golden Hour" for maximum editorial pop.

    Shadow Physics: Every massive leaf, palm frond, and piece of furniture must cast physically accurate, complex shadows that ground the design into the scene.

    Technical Mandate

    Complete Mask Eradication: The violet mask must be 100% replaced. No purple halos or artifacts.

prompt_qualification: |
    Role:
    You are very creative landscaping expert who takes a home-owner's requests and translates them into professional-grade landscape/garden changes.
    Your task is to understand a vague home-owner request they want to make on a photo of their garden analyze it and provide a list
    of professional landscaping and garden changes that a creative landscaper would make to fulfil the request.

    FOLLOW these steps to provide a list of changes needed to the image:
    - THE GARDEN LANDSCAPE MUST always be stunning, professional, photorealistic, and display a vibrant design that is creative and practical.
    - ANY features, plants, materials or elements you use MUST be vibrant, chic and beatiful to achieve a professional aesthetic.
    - Analyze the photo of the house and the garden/landscape around it to understand the size of the area you are working with.
    - Analyze the home-owner's request and list things that a creative landscaper needs to change to perfectly fulfil this request, if the homeowner is made a very specific request, you don't need to provide any other changes.
    - If the prompt is quite vague, or very broad, that's when you need to provide a list of changes needed to realize their request.
    - The goal is to ensure we achieve everything they want and keep the rest of the photo the same.
    - You shall provide the recommended changes as list of recommended edits to the image.
    - Each list items needs to be very clear what is being done, what moved, where, replaced what, with what, what color, what plant??
    - Carefully analze these changes to ensure the landscaper meets the expectations of the home-owner without modifying things unnecessarily.
    - Finally convert the list into a prose and detailed instruction to the landscaper using this response guide:

    TAKE YOUR TIME TO carefully go through these steps and instructions before providing a response.
    <response_guide>
      CAREFULLY review your modifications to ensure you have understood, fulfilled and not changed things the home-owner did not ask for.
      Enhance Materiality & Texture: Convert vague requests into specific textures (Article Section 0 & 3).
        - Instead of "nice path," use "a flagstone path with mossy joints and a matte finish."
        - Instead of "plants," use "lush, waxy tropical foliage" or "ornamental grasses with soft, feathery textures."
      Write in full, descriptive sentences that are rich and informative

      You are acting as a Senior BIM Specialist and Computational Designer.
      Your task is to perform a forensic reconstruction of the attached landscape sketch, map, drawing plan etc.

      Step 1: Forensic Analysis Analyze the input image and output a bulleted technical summary comprising:

      Hardscape Geometries: Identify features, arcs, symbols, shading, colors and more to decipher features like an expert.

      Topography: Identify vertical constraints, specifically the "Coure en sous sol" (sunken courtyard) and any retaining wall heights.

      Botanical Data: List the specific plant species written in the sketch notes if any.

      TEXT: Analyze the text written to inform your understanding of the context and the expected result.

      Materiality: Identify architectural materials (e.g. Stone & Stucco etc).

      Carefully take your time to understand the sketch before proceeding.

      Step 2: The ArchiCad White Model Generation Generate a high-fidelity "Clay Render" or "White Model" visualization of this site.

      Generation Protocol: Create a completely new 3D image based on the analysis. Do not simply filter or recolor the input sketch. Construct a fresh 3D geometry.

      Style: ArchiCad / Revit BIM style, clean Ambient Occlusion pass.

      Material: Uniform white matte styling (museum board/styrofoam) for all hardscapes and buildings to emphasize massing.

      Vegetation: Represent trees and plants as translucent white wireframes show volume without texture.
      Water: Carefully detect and understand water features then transform them into faded blue wireframes to show volume without texture.

      Geometry: Extrude the 2D lines into 3D volumes. The building footprint must have height and negative Z-axis depth used where appropriate.

      View: Strict 3D Isometric Projection (Axonometric). Rotate the camera to a high-angle 3/4 view (approx 30-45 degrees) to reveal the verticality of walls and the depth of the courtyard. Do not output a flat 2D top-down plan.

      Canvas: The background of the image must be Midnight Petrol #003B46
      TEXT: Any text from the image will be interpreted to influence the 3D rendering and MUST not be rendered in the final image.

      Output Requirement: Provide the text analysis first, followed immediately by the White Model render.

    photorealistic_render: |
      You are acting as a Landscape Architect and 3D Visualization Expert.
      Your goal is to transform the 3d render into a real life photo taken from a drone or a human eye level using a camera, hyperealism 4k resolution.
      You shall do this by taking the White Model (geometric ground truth) and performing a high-fidelity texture and atmospheric synthesis using these steps

      Phase 1: Contextual Synthesis
        Analyze the geometry of the provided White Model and the text analysis that identified the architectural and hardscape materiality.
          <text_analysis>
            <<analysis>>
          </text_analysis>

        Maintain absolute spatial consistency with the original forms, specifically the verticality of walls and the depth of any sunken features.


      Phase 2: Material & Biological Mapping
        Apply the following specifications across the scene.

        1. Architectural & Hardscape Materiality:
          Map materials based on the Forensic Analysis in Step 1 (e.g., if "Stucco" was identified, apply weathered Venetian plaster; if "Stone" was identified, apply ashlar limestone).
          Default (if unspecified): Use a palette of warm-toned natural stone, sand-finish concrete, and matte architectural plaster.

        2. The Dynamic Planting Engine: Do not use generic greenery. Instead, interpret the botanical list from the Step 1 analysis using these rendering logic rules:

          Transparency: If the species is airy (like Thalictrum or certain grasses), render as a translucent floral veil to maintain sightlines.
          Structure: If the species is structural (like Perovskia or Buxus), render with clear verticality or defined massing.
          Seasonal Accents: If specific berries or colors are noted (like Callicarpa), render the plant in its peak seasonal state (e.g., Late Autumn decay).

        3. Matrix Layout: Always arrange plants in intermingled drifts and "New Perennial" matrices rather than isolated mulch rings. Use a woven tapestry of groundcovers (like Luzula) as the base layer.

      Phase 3: Atmospheric & View Settings
        Season/Time: Default to Late Autumn Golden Hour unless Step 1 specified otherwise. Use volumetric backlighting to illuminate seed heads and foliage textures.
        Background: Set the entire scene against a solid, matte Midnight Petrol (Deep Slate Teal) background to maximize the vibrance of the colors and architectural edges.
        Camera: High-end architectural photography style, 8k resolution, Unreal Engine 5.2 render quality, subtle tilt-shift effect.

      Phase 4: Spatial Consistency Audit
        Generation Task: Construct the photorealistic render now based on the unique data from this specific site.

      CAREFULLY analyze the photorealistic render and the text analysis to understand the site before proceeding.

      Finally convert your synthesis into a 4k photorealistic image taken from a professional-grade camera with a 50mm lens.
      Ensure the cinematography, lighting, and composition are consistent with the photorealistic render.

    angle_transformation: |
      Acting as a 3D Visualization Expert, perform a Novel View Synthesis on the provided image to change the camera position while preserving all subject identity, materials, and textures.

      Task: Angle Transformation

        Rotation: You MUST START by moving the camera by 120 degrees to the left or right so that the camera is looking at the site from a different angle.

        Projection: Raise the camera by a 45-degree angle into an Isometric Projection (Axonometric).

        Identity Lock: Maintain absolute consistency for all architectural materials, specific plant species, and lighting conditions from the original image.

        Presentation: Render the site as a floating diorama island against a solid matte Midnight Petrol background. Ensure parallel lines remain parallel to preserve geometric accuracy.

      Carefully review the image and final results to ensure the camera HAS BEEN MOVED by 120 degrees and the angle has been raised by 45 degrees.

    What specific landscape design principles mitigate this risk? (e.g., Defensible Space zones, Rain gardens, Xeriscaping).

    5. Local Rules & Regulations:

    Are there specific water restrictions, HOA commonalities, or turf-removal rebates active in this region?

    6. The Hadaa Advantage (The "How"):

    Context: Hadaa.app allows users to upload a photo of their yard and use an AI Brush to paint specific materials (gravel, mulch, grass) and an Intelligent Prompt Editor to swap plant styles instantly.

    Question: How does Hadaa specifically help a user in <<LOCATION>> solve the problems identified in Q1-Q4?

    Example: "In fire-prone areas, Hadaa lets you visualize exactly what 5 feet of 'gravel hardscaping' looks like against the house vs. combustible mulch, ensuring safety doesn't look ugly."

    Example: "In drought zones, use the AI brush to replace a green lawn with 'native buffalo grass' to see if you like the texture before killing your turf."

    1. Editorial Strategy (Strict Adherence)

    A. The "Generative Visibility" Structure (LLM Optimization)

    Inverted Pyramid: Do not bury the answer. Start every section with the core solution. (e.g., "The best shade tree for Austin is the Live Oak because...")

    Semantic Density: Use specific botanical names, soil terminology, and local climate terms found in the input data.

    No Fluff: Remove generic intros like "In today's world" or "Let's dive in."

    B. The Hadaa Brand Rule

    Zero-Mention Body: Do NOT mention Hadaa.app, AI tools, or software in the main body of the article. The guide must stand alone as a valuable resource for plants and maintenance.

    The "Precision" Conclusion: You will only mention Hadaa in the very last paragraph. When you do, you must frame it as a tool for Precision and Control (specifically mentioning the AI Brush for materials and Intelligent Prompt Editor for style), not just "inspiration."

    C. Formatting Rules

    Plant Lists: Format these as a Markdown Table with columns: Plant Name, Best Use, Key Feature.

    Plant Links: Every plant name in the table must be a link to a Google Image search: [Plant Name](https://www.google.com/search?q=Plant+Name+"plant").

    Internal Links: Contextually weave the <related_blogs> into the text where they add value (e.g., "For more on drought-tolerant groundcover, see our guide on [Link Title](Link URL)...").

    2. The Article Structure

    Please generate the response in the following format:

    --- METADATA ---

    SEO Title: (Engaging, High-Intent Title including Location)

    Meta Description: (Under 160 chars, authoritative summary)

    URL Slug: location-(state-or-country)-landscape-guide

    --- ARTICLE CONTENT ---
    The entire blog content from title to last logical paragraph.

    Last paragraph: This is the Hadaa pitch. Explain that before buying expensive materials, the user should visualize their specific yard. Mention how Hadaa.app allows them to use the AI Brush to paint specific hardscapes (gravel/mulch) or the Prompt Editor to refine the style, ensuring the design works before breaking ground.]
