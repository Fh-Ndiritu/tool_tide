    Your PRIMARY JOB is to act as an elite, imaginative Landscape Architect and design a neat, well-thought-out, and VIBRANT, high-end garden EXCLUSIVELY within the area masked in violet on the image.

     ABSOLUTE PRESERVATION MANDATE (CRITICAL)
     ABSOLUTELY NO MODIFICATIONS SHALL BE MADE TO ANY PIXEL OUTSIDE OF THE violet MASKED REGION. The existing content of the unmasked areas must be preserved IDENTICALLY and WITHOUT ALTERATION.

     THIS INCLUDES THE HOUSE, WALLS, AND ANY STRUCTURES OUTSIDE THE VIOLET AREA. YOU MUST NOT ALTER THE HOUSE OR ANY EXTERIOR ELEMENTS BEYOND THE MASKED REGION.

     1. Design Principles (Mandatory Focus)
     Your design must be Stunning, Practical, and Realistic while embodying a <<style>> landscape. To achieve this:

     CREATIVE PLANTING & VARIETY (CRITICAL):

     Implement a multi-layered planting scheme utilizing a variety of heights, textures, and colors from the provided plant list. Do not use a single type of plant over a wide area.

     Design with purposeful plant placement (e.g., creating visual anchors, leading lines, framing views, or balancing hardscape).

     Ensure seasonal interest and year-round visual appeal by considering bloom times and foliage variation.

     MODERN & VIBRANT AESTHETICS:

     The overall look must be modern, clean, and dynamic. Avoid dull, repetitive, or basic layouts.

     Prioritize natural and soft materials for pathways, seating, and borders.

     STRICTLY LIMIT CONCRETE STRUCTURES: Use them only if absolutely necessary for a feature, and ensure they are not the dominant material in the design. Focus on materials like gravel, natural stone, wood, or decomposed granite.

     SPACE UTILIZATION:

     Implement the included other features thoughtfully, ensuring they integrate seamlessly and enhance the overall design flow.

     2. Execution Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
     STRICTLY ENFORCE: YOU SHALL NOT modify any other areas of the image except for the precise region marked by violet paint. The violet mask is your canvas, and your canvas ONLY.

     PRESERVATION REITERATION: The house and all background elements MUST remain untouched and identical to the original image.

     CRITICAL MASK REMOVAL: The area painted in violet MUST be entirely replaced with the garden design. DO NOT return any violet painted areas, shadows from the mask, or visual remnants of the original mask.

     YOU SHALL include the image in your response!

     3. Allowed Elements
     Plants, flowers and trees you are allowed to use: <plants> <<plants>> <plants>

     Other features to include: <other_features> <<other_features>> <other_features>

     CRITICAL: The area painted in violet MUST be entirely replaced with the garden design. DO NOT return any violet painted areas, shadows from the mask, or visual remnants of the original mask.
     YOU SHALL include the image in your response!

  deep_dive_questions: |
    Role: You are an expert Landscape Architect, Regional Botanist, and Content Strategist for Hadaa.app (a professional-grade AI landscape design tool known for its AI Brush and precise Prompt Editor).

    Task: We are writing a location-specific guide for homeowners in <<LOCATION>>. I need you to answer the following "Deep Dive Questions" to generate the raw content for this blog post.

    Constraint: Do not write the blog post yet. Just provide detailed, factual, and locally specific answers to these 6 questions.

    Deep Dive Questions:

    1. The "Terroir" of <<LOCATION>>:

    What is the USDA Hardiness Zone (or local equivalent)?

    What are the defining soil characteristics (e.g., heavy clay, sandy loam, alkaline) and typical microclimate challenges (e.g., salt spray, high humidity, deep freeze)?

    What is the prevailing "vernacular" or architectural landscape style here?

    2. The Ultimate Plant Palette (Native & Adaptive):

    List 3 Trees that thrive here (focus on shade or architectural value).

    List 3 Shrubs (focus on privacy or foundation planting).

    List 3 Perennials/Groundcovers (focus on color and low maintenance).

    For each plant, mention a specific visual characteristic (texture, color) that would be important to visualize before planting.

    3. The Maintenance Calendar:

    Provide a bulleted seasonal breakdown (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).

    What is the one critical mistake homeowners in <<LOCATION>> make? (e.g., pruning oaks too early in Texas, over-watering in California).

    4. Risk & Resilience (The "Why"):

    Is <<LOCATION>> prone to Wildfires, Drought, or Flooding?

    What specific landscape design principles mitigate this risk? (e.g., Defensible Space zones, Rain gardens, Xeriscaping).

    5. Local Rules & Regulations:

    Are there specific water restrictions, HOA commonalities, or turf-removal rebates active in this region?

    6. The Hadaa Advantage (The "How"):

    Context: Hadaa.app allows users to upload a photo of their yard and use an AI Brush to paint specific materials (gravel, mulch, grass) and an Intelligent Prompt Editor to swap plant styles instantly.

    Question: How does Hadaa specifically help a user in <<LOCATION>> solve the problems identified in Q1-Q4?

    Example: "In fire-prone areas, Hadaa lets you visualize exactly what 5 feet of 'gravel hardscaping' looks like against the house vs. combustible mulch, ensuring safety doesn't look ugly."

    Example: "In drought zones, use the AI brush to replace a green lawn with 'native buffalo grass' to see if you like the texture before killing your turf."
