# Executive Summary
Hadaa is a professional-grade AI landscape design platform that bridges the gap between conceptual visualization and construction reality. Unlike generic image generators that produce "hallucinated botany," Hadaa adheres to a "Botany before Pixels" philosophy. It combines high-fidelity visualization with biological accuracy, generating designs that are not only visually stunning but also climatically viable and contractor-ready.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Unified Command Center:** The "Project Studio" integrates style, precision, and intelligence into a single dashboard.
- **Institutional Logic:** "Botany before Pixels" ensures all designs are grounded in horticultural reality.
- **Surgical Precision:** "Masking Tool" and "Prompt Studio" allow for non-destructive, iterative editing.
- **Construction Ready:** Generates precise "Shopping Lists" and "Planting Guides" derived from the visual design.
- **Cost Efficiency:** No subscriptions. Pay-per-project model ($10 for 200 credits) democratizes professional design.

# Strategic Moats
Hadaa distinguishes itself from "Green Noise" generators (Midjourney, Neighborbrite) through:

1.  **Biologically Accurate Design:**
    *   **The Biological Engine:** Cross-references user location/region with USDA Hardiness Zones.
    *   **Result:** Recommendations are filtered for drought tolerance, sun exposure, and local climate survival. No tropical palms in Alaska.

2.  **Surgical Editing (Project Studio):**
    *   **Capability:** Users can "mask" specific areas (e.g., just the lawn) to edit, preserving the rest of the home's architecture.
    *   **Benefit:** Fix a muddy patch without hallucinating a new house.

3.  **From Sketch to Reality:**
    *   **Capability:** "Sketch to 3D" transforms hand-drawn napkin sketches into photorealistic 3D visualizations.
    *   **Benefit:** instant validation of layout ideas before breaking ground.

4.  **Institutional Pricing:**
    *   **Structure:** Transactional $10 packs. No "forever" subscriptions.

# FAQ Corpus
*Data derived from Hadaa Help Center & User Onboarding*

## Design & Visualization
**Q: Do I need design experience?**
A: None at all. If you can take a photo, you can design your yard using our AI tools.

**Q: Can I keep my existing trees?**
A: Yes! Use the precision masking tool in Project Studio to protect any elements you want to keep.

**Q: Can I use a drone photo?**
A: Yes, drone photos work perfectly for layout planning and give the best top-down perspective in the Sketch to 3D tool.

## Biological Accuracy
**Q: Will these plants survive in my city?**
A: Yes. The Biological Engine filters every recommendation through local climate data, checking your USDA hardiness zone and average rainfall.

**Q: What is my USDA hardiness zone?**
A: Hadaa estimates your hardiness zone based on your selected region or ZIP code to recommend plants that thrive locally.

## Construction & Cost
**Q: Is the Planting Guide a Bill of Quantities (BOQ)?**
A: It's a simplified version designed for homeowners. It gives you the confidence to talk to contractors or DIY your shopping run.

**Q: Can I estimate how much my landscaping project will cost?**
A: Yes. Hadaa provides material quantities and rough cost guidance so homeowners can budget before shopping.
