        <h2 class="text-3xl font-black mb-6 text-white">The Origin Story</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
          Hadaa didn't start in a boardroom. It started in a messy backyard.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
          Our founder, frustration mounting, was trying to renovate a simple garden. The options were bleak: pay a landscape architect $5,000 for a PDF that took weeks to arrive, or struggle with clunky, 90s-era CAD software that required a PhD to operate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
          There had to be a better way. We wanted to fuse the creative freedom of generative AI with the biological constraints of real-world botany. We wanted a tool that didn't just "paint" a garden, but understood climate zones, sun exposure, and drainage.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
          So we built it. <strong class="text-white">From scratch.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
          What began as a hacky script to automate planting layouts quickly evolved. We hosted it, shared it with a few friends, and suddenly, homeowners and pros alike were clamoring for access. They loved the speed. They loved the cost-cutting. They loved the ability to iterate 50 times in an hour instead of once a week.

           <p class="text-neutral-400">
             We believe design should be democratic. You shouldn't need a budget of tens of thousands to visualize a beautiful, sustainable outdoor space. We give you the professional tools to cut costs, get feedback instantly, and iterate until it's perfect.

           <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#f23faf]">The Technology</h3>
           <p class="text-neutral-400">
             We are not just a wrapper around Stable Diffusion. We are a specialized engine trained on landscape architecture principals, fine-tuned for biological accuracy, and optimized for construction readiness.
