        <p class="text-neutral-400">
          Hadaa operates on a credit-based system. Access to professional features requires the purchase of credits. Pricing is transparently displayed on our pricing page and at checkout. All prices are in USD unless otherwise stated.

            <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
              We strive to provide the highest quality AI landscape generation. However, because our service relies on expensive, real-time GPU processing power for every single image generation, we are unable to offer refunds for credit purchases once they have been used.
            </p>
            <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Please treat your credits with care. We appreciate your understanding as this policy allows us to maintain the high-performance infrastructure required to deliver professional-grade results.

        <p class="text-neutral-400">
          You own the commercial rights to the images you generate using Hadaa. You may use them for client presentations, marketing materials, and construction documentation. However, you may not resell the raw generation capability or wrap our API without explicit permission.
