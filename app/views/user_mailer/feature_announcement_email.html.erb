      <p>Hi <%= @user.name || "there" %>,</p>

      <% if @user.last_design_date %>
        <p>I saw the garden design you were working on around <%= @user.last_design_date.strftime("%B %d") %>. It looked like an interesting project, so I wanted to reach out personally.</p>
      <% else %>
        <p>I noticed you joined Hadaa recently but haven't started your first design yet. I wanted to reach out personally to help you get going.</p>
      <% end %>

      <p>We've just pushed a few updates to Hadaa that might help you:</p>

      <p>1. <strong>Localized Plants</strong>: We now suggest greenery that specifically thrives in <%= @user.location_city || "your climate" %>, so your design is actually plantable.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Smart Sketch</strong>: You can now turn rough hand-drawn maps into photorealistic 3D views instantly.</p>

      <p><strong>I’d love your honest feedback on these.</strong></p>

      <p>To make it worth your while, I’ve added 50 credits to your account. You can activate them here:</p>
