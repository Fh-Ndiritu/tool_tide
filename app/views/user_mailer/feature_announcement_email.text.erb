Hi <%= @user.name || "there" %>,

<% if @user.last_design_date %>
I saw the garden design you were working on around <%= @user.last_design_date.strftime("%B %d") %>. It looked like an interesting project, so I wanted to reach out personally.
<% else %>
I noticed you joined Hadaa recently but haven't started your first design yet. I wanted to reach out personally to help you get going.
<% end %>

We've just pushed a few updates to Hadaa that might help you:

1. Localized Plants: We now suggest greenery that specifically thrives in <%= @user.location_city || "your climate" %>, so your design is actually plantable.
2. Smart Sketch: You can now turn rough hand-drawn maps into photorealistic 3D views instantly.

I’ve added 50 credits to your account to help you try these out. You can use this link to activate them:

Could you do me a favor? After you try the new tools, just hit Reply and let me know if the plant suggestions felt right for <%= @user.location_city || "your area" %>. I read every reply.

Best,
Winnie
