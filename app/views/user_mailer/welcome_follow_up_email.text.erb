Hi there,

I noticed you brushed an area you want to modify in your yard.
<% when 'sketch' %>
I noticed you made a sketch to 3D transformation.
<% when 'text' %>
I noticed you struggled to make prompt edits for your designs.
<% else %>
I noticed you signed up but haven't started a design yet.
<% end %>

I wanted to reach out and see how your experience has been so far.

Are you finding inspiration or doing professional editing? Is there any way we can help?

We want to make sure you get the most out of the tool.

Cheers,
Winnie
