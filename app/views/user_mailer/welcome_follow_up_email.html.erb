    <p>I saw you were checking out Hadaa on your phone earlier. If you get a chance, try logging in on a desktop.</p>

    <p>How is everything going so far? I noticed you haven't started a project yet.</p>
    <p>If you're stuck on where to begin, I'd recommend starting a quick project in the Studio just to see how the AI tools handle your ideas. It’s the best way to get a feel for the workflow.</p>

    <p>Quick tip for your next design: have you tried the Style Presets yet?</p>
    <p>They’re basically a one-click way to see your project in a completely different light. It usually saves people a ton of time when they're looking for a specific professional direction.</p>
