This updated blueprint is specifically engineered for **hadaa.pro** based on your internal onboarding data, which confirms that roughly **75% of your users are homeowners** primarily seeking **visualization (82 users)** and **inspiration (68 users)**.

This strategy pivots away from "flaky" broad hooks to focus on high-intent terms that solve the "Knowledge" gap (38 users) and the "Renovation" intent (33 users), positioning the $10 credit model as a high-value alternative to expensive traditional designers.

### 1. High-Intent Keyword Architecture for Homeowners

To align with your **Visualization** and **Knowledge** pain points, your content must move from "generic image generation" to "project-specific utility".

| Cluster | User Intent | Primary Focus | Keyword Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **The "See It" Cluster** | Visualization (Top-Funnel) | Uploading real photos to see instant change. | "AI backyard visualizer from photo," "remodel my yard with AI," "front yard makeover simulator," "see my house with new pavers" |
| **The "Survival" Cluster** | Knowledge Gap (Mid-Funnel) | Biological accuracy and climate-specific success. | "USDA zone [Zone] planting list AI," "native plants for [City] garden," "drought resistant yard planner," "plants for clay soil AI" |
| **The "Action" Cluster** | Renovation (Bottom-Funnel) | Moving from a picture to a real digging project.

 | "backyard shopping list generator," "landscaping material cost calculator," "construction ready garden plans," "DIY yard layout with measurements" |
| **The "Economic" Cluster** | Cost-Conscious Discovery | Positioning the $10 credits against the $5,000 quote. | "affordable landscape concept plan," "landscape designer vs AI cost," "fixed price backyard design," "cheap professional garden renders" |
